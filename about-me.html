            <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
            <p>As I was exploring the internet, I became fascinated not just by what I was seeing, but by how it was built. I found myself drawn to the fluid animations, responsive layouts, and interactive elements that made certain websites feel so dynamic. This curiosity led me to discover the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I quickly realized that frontend development was the perfect way to combine my love for design and my passion for problem-solving. It was then I knew I had found my path.</p>
            <p class="italic">- After that, here I am..</p>
            <p>I love frontend because it's where creativity meets code. There's nothing more satisfying than building an interactive, beautiful user interface and watching it come to life.
